We're following up on our recent release of [`@studiocms/ui`](https://npmjs.com/package/@studiocms/ui) with version 0.3.0, 
dubbed "The Accessibility Update". 

Here's a quick overview of what we've worked on for this release:

- All components have been updated to adhere to the [ARIA guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
- A new [`<Tabs />` component](https://ui.studiocms.dev/docs/components/tabs/) has been added, at the request of a community member
- The library has been turned into an integration to allow us to add more exciting features down the line
- All scripts are now modularized & bundled, meaning less front-end JS for you!

Check out [the documentation](https://ui.studiocms.dev) to find out how to get started, or check out the 
[source code on GitHub](https://github.com/withstudiocms/UI) (and maybe give it a star)! You can also 
[request new components with our issue templates](https://github.com/withstudiocms/ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feat&projects=&template=2-feature-request.yml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+)!

*Don't ask what happened to 0.2.0. We don't talk about that one. I might've fumbled.*
