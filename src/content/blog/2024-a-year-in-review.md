As 2024 has come to a close, we’re reflecting on an incredible journey for StudioCMS, our open-source content management system designed for the Astro ecosystem. This year has been one of growth, innovation, and community-building, and we’re excited to share our milestones with you.

## The Beginning

StudioCMS started in early  March 2024 but officially launched in late April after we joined the Astrolicious organization with the goal of simplifying and unifying SSR content management for Astro developers. From the start, our focus has been on creating an open-source, MIT-licensed ecosystem that empowers developers to build dynamic, content-rich websites with ease. The journey began with the release of our core `studiocms` package, and since then, we’ve consistently delivered improvements and new features.

## Beta Progress: From 0.1.0-beta.1 to beta.7

Over the course of the year, we released seven beta versions, culminating in `0.1.0-beta.7`. Each release brought significant enhancements, bug fixes, and new integrations, all aimed at making StudioCMS more robust and developer-friendly. We’re currently hard at work on `0.1.0-beta.8`, which will introduce a complete redesign of the StudioCMS dashboard and leverage the powerful new `@studiocms/ui` component library.

## Moving to Our Own Organization

While StudioCMS initially began under the Astrolicious organization, we made the decision later in the year to establish our own independent organization: [withstudiocms](https://github.com/withstudiocms). This move allowed us to better align our branding and operations with our vision for the project. The transition marked a new chapter, giving us the freedom to expand our ecosystem, focus on long-term sustainability, and define a clear identity as an open-source leader in the Astro community.

## Introducing `@studiocms/ui`

One of the standout achievements this year was the creation of `@studiocms/ui`, a modern Astro component library designed to streamline UI development. Built by [Louis Escher](https://github.com/louisescher), who joined our team as a designer and Maintainer, this library is central to our ecosystem. It powers the redesigned dashboard in beta.8 and is available for all Astro community members to use and contribute to. You can explore it at [ui.studiocms.dev](https://ui.studiocms.dev) or on GitHub at [@withstudiocms/ui](https://github.com/withstudiocms/ui).

## Expanding the Ecosystem: `@studiocms/markdown-remark`

This year also saw the release of our first utility package, `@studiocms/markdown-remark`. This powerful Markdown parser and transformer is built on top of `remark` and integrates seamlessly with Astro. It provides the flexibility to parse and transform Markdown content, offering compatibility with Astro’s `@astrojs/markdown-remark` package and its options. Developers can now leverage this tool to enhance their Astro projects with ease. Check it out on GitHub at [@withstudiocms/markdown-remark](https://github.com/withstudiocms/markdown-remark).

## Support from Turso.tech

We’re thrilled to have received sponsorship from [Turso.tech](https://turso.tech) earlier this year. Their support has been instrumental in helping us expand our vision and continue building a sustainable open-source project.

## Looking Ahead

As we look to 2025, we’re committed to pushing StudioCMS forward. With the upcoming beta.8 release, the redesigned dashboard, and continued expansion of our plugin ecosystem, we’re excited to see what the next year will bring. We’re also deeply grateful to our contributors and community members for their support, feedback, and code contributions that make StudioCMS what it is today.
